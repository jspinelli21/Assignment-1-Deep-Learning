They use a metric called TF-IDF, where TF is term frequence and idf is inverse document frequency.  The former ranks a document higher the more the query terms appear in that document, and the latter ranks a document higher if it has terms from the query that appear infrequently across all documents.  The specific way they calculate it is log(number of documents / number of documents with the term) - ie, the inverse of the frequency that the term appears.</p>\\n\\n<p>So in your example, those phrases are SIPs relative to Joel's book because they are rare phrases (appearing in few books) and they appear multiple times in his book.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  in response to the question about 2-grams and 3-grams, overlap doesn't matter.  Consider the sentence \\\"my two dogs are brown\\\".  Here, the list of 2-grams is [\\\"my two\\\", \\\"two dogs\\\", \\\"dogs are\\\", \\\"are brown\\\"], and the list of 3-grams is [\\\"my two dogs\\\", \\\"two dogs are\\\", \\\"dogs are brown\\\"].  As I mentioned in my comment, with overlap you get N-1 2-grams and N-2 3-grams for a stream of N words.  Because 2-grams can only equal other 2-grams and likewise for 3-grams, you can handle each of these cases separately.  When processing 2-grams, every \\\"word\\\" will be a 2-gram, etc.</p>\\n\"\n",

So I would recommend going over probability theory first and then tackling an NLP book (like the second one I linked to, which I am actually using on a project right now with pretty good results).</p>\\n\\n<p>While I agree with laura that formal language theory is highly useful, I actually think that currently if you just want to get into the actual NL parts of NLP, you can leave formal languages for later as there are enough tools that will do your lexical analysis / parsing / tokenizing / text transformations that you can use those rather than roll your own.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here is a book describing three such tools - I own it and recommend it as a good introduction to all three.  <a href=\\\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0615204252\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noreferrer\\\">Building Search Applications: Lucene, LingPipe, and Gate</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Edit:  in response to your question, I would say that the first step would be to get a thorough grounding in the basics of probability (the first 3-5 chapters of any undergrad prob/stats book should be fine), and then from there look up new topics as they come up in the NLP book.  For instance, yesterday I had to learn about t-values or something (I'm bad with names) because they happened to be relevant to determining incidence of collocation.</p>\\n\"\n",
